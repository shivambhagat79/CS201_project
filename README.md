## Language and compiling

The code is written in C language version 23 and can be compiled using GCC/G++ compiler on any PC.

For compiling the program run the following command in terminal:

```
gcc main.c -lm
```

it will generate a file named a.out on Linux and Mac and, and a.exe file on Windows. to run the program, run the following command in terminal:

```
<!-- for Linux/Mac -->
./a.out

<!-- For windows -->
./a.exe
```

## Usage

The program first takes sample data from the 'sample_data.txt' file and creates a domey directory of 200 entries.

After the initial step the program runs on a menu based structure in which each operation can be performed using the menu entries and following the instructions printed ahead.

The program only takes string input for names (only alphabets) and long long int for phone numbers. any invalid input will throw and error and exit the program.
